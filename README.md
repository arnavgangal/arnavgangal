Hi! I'm Arnav. I am a Master's student at Stanford University, studying in Statistics and Data Science. I recently graduated from UCLA, where I majored in Applied Math, specialized in Computing, and minored in Statistics and Data Science. I have research experience in computational math, particularly in using physics-informed neural networks to solve partial differential equations. 

I'm currently interested in competitive learning methods such as self-organizing maps (SOMs), deep generative models for synthetic datasets, and causal inference techniques.. I am also interested in collaborative filtering recommendation techniques. I have a particular love for sports data science, especially baseball analytics. I'm always interested in research or internship opportunities in data science and machine learning, and am reachable at agangal00@gmail.com.
